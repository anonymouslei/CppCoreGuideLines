S24: B2U: from a bit level representation to an unsigned number of some bit pattern

until: 25:58

<!-- Then I'll treat themn as a signed case,  -->
if either of them is unsigned, Then I will convert the other one to be an unsigned number and do the operation.

可以使用对称性来计算绝对值

```c
if (x < 0)
    return -x;
else
    return x;
```
if we input TMin, it will returns TMin.
It is always a corner case and whenever we do program testing.

UMax = 2*TMax + 1
